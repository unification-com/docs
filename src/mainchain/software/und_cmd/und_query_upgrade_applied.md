## und query upgrade applied

block header for height at which a completed upgrade was applied

### Synopsis

If upgrade-name was previously executed on the chain, this returns the header for the block at which it was applied.
This helps a client determine which binary was valid over a given range of blocks, as well as more context to understand past migrations.
